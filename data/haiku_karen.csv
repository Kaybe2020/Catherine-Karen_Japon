Akita,“The light of a candle”,The light of a candle —,Is transferred to another candle,spring twilight., Yosa Buson,Write by a haiku's Great Masters.Yosa Buson is known for bringing in a certain sensuality to his poems (perhaps owing to his training as a painter). In this haiku, his image of a single lit candle against the twilight artfully depicts how one candle can light another without being diminished — until you have a star-filled sky.  
Nagano,“A World of Dew”,This world of dew,is a world of dew,and yet...and yet., Kobayashi Issa,Write by the third master of Japanese haiku Kobayashi Issa. He grew up in poverty.

This particularly emotionally stirring haiku was written a month after the passing of Issa’s daughter. 
Naha,“A Poppy Blooms”,I write. Erase. Rewrite,Erase again and then,A poppy blooms., Katsushika Hokusai,In this piece Katsushika Hokusai draws similarities between life and his writing — both processes of repetitive creation and destruction. Neither are linear or smooth and both demand constant work and perseverance. However the reward of his perseverance is something undeniably beautiful.
Sendai,“In the moonlight”,In pale moonlight,the wisteria’s scent,comes from far away., Yosa Buson,Buson invites the reader to share in his nostalgia with elements from nature such as ‘pale moonlight’ and the ‘wisteria’s scent’ triggering the our visual and olfactory senses — the fact that the scent is coming from far away adds a transportive element to the poem and asking us to imagine the unseen beauty of this tree.
Miyazaki,“O snail”,O snail,Climb Mount Fuji.,But slowly... slowly!, Kobayashi Issa,Aside from his pessimistic worldview. Issa was also renowned for shining a spotlight on smaller - less-than-glamorous creatures like grasshoppers - bugs and sparrows. In “O snail” he gently reminds the determined snail that while there are important things to do in life (like climbing mountains). there’s more to life than speed! The mountain isn’t going to go anywhere - is it? 
Nara,“I want to sleep”,I want to sleep,Swat the flies,Softly... please., Masaoka Shiki,Write by the last of the Four Great Masters of haiku Masaoka Shiki. He had a very direct writing style. Suffering tuberculosis for much of his life and his poetry was an outlet for his isolation. He would often focus on the trivial details of sick-room life and in this haiku - his sadness and fatigue are almost palpable.
Hikone,“After Killing a Spider”,After killing,a spider... how lonely I feel,in the cold of night!, Masaoka Shiki,Masaoka Shiki’s “After Killing a Spider” is a prime example of haiku’s ability to capture the minutiae of life. Filled with loneliness and regret. After Killing a Spider depicts exactly what it says on the tin. But then it goes further into the speaker’s emotions after the incident — for after killing his only companion - the speaker is left alone in the cold of the night. What’s also interesting is that the first break comes after the word ‘killing’ emphasizing the brutality the speaker felt on performing the act - even if it was just a spider.
Kyoto,“[I kill an ant]”,I kill an ant,and realize my three children,have been watching., Kato Shuson,If you haven't had your fill of bug-killing action here’s a haiku from Kato Shuson. As with “After killing a spider” the speaker doesn’t feel remorse at having ended a life — but perhaps regrets allowing their kids to see their savage tendencies. Though short in length, this haiku imparts a powerful message: be the person that you want your children to see.
Mibu,“Over The Wintry”,Over the wintry,forest and winds. Howl in rage,with no leaves to blow., Natsume Sōse,One can easily imagine the person represented by the metaphorical wind in this haiku: someone in their winter years who has spent the year railing against the world and only to be left with no one left to listen. While spring often represents the idea of hope in poetry - winter surely is the season of regret.
Tokyo,“[cherry blossoms]”,cherry blossoms,fall! fall!,enough to fill my belly, Kobayashi Issa,Cherry blossoms are a big deal in Japan. So it’s no surprise that they often turn up in haiku. In this poem the cherry blossom festival must be in full swing and the speaker can barely control their excitement. Wishing for more — an excess of it that - surfeiting - the appetite might sicken and so die (as Shakespeare might say). It’s enough to make you want to book the next available flight to Tokyo.
Yokohama,“[The lamp once out]”,The lamp once out,Cool stars enter,The window frame., Natsume Soseki,This is a classic by Natsume Soseki. A widely respected novelist and haiku writer. You might read it literally and thinking that one can marvel at the night sky in all of its wonder as soon as the light of the lamp on the street goes out or you can also interpret the lamp as an active mind 一 only when we manage to quiet it can we access a deeper - wiser source of light - represented by the stars. 
Hiroshima,“[The snow of yesterday]”,The snow of yesterday,That fell like cherry blossoms,Is water once again, Gozan,The art of writing haiku demands an almost superhuman level of observation. Aida Bunnosuke also known as Gozan - speaks about the impermanence of our surroundings by noticing how snowflakes turn into water in very little time. This theme of the ephemeral nature of life is again emphasized by the cherry blossoms which only last for about a week after peak bloom.
Nara,“[First autumn morning]”,First autumn morning,the mirror I stare into,shows my father's face., Murakami Kijo,Born in Tokyo in 1865 - Murakami Kijo helped with the founding of Hototogisu a literary magazine responsible for popularizing the modern haiku in Japan.

Fukuoka,“[What is it but a dream?]”,What is it but a dream?,The blooming as well,Lasts only seven cycles, Hakuen Ekaku,This pensive haiku by Hakuen Ekaku broodingly reflects on the theme of death. As haiku writers like to remind us - the blooming of the most beautiful of nature’s occurrences like spring cherry blossom are always temporary. Coincidentally Hakuen’s life also spanned seven cycles as he died at the age of sixty-six.
Tateyama,“[Even in Kyoto]”,Even in Kyoto,Hearing the cuckoo’s cry,I long for Kyoto, Kobayashi Issa,In this classic piece by Kobayashi Issa - a bird’s call brings him back to his early days as a student in Kyoto. The poem exudes a certain nostalgia and longing for that time in his life which is now lost 一 something we can all relate to in our own ways. 
Konan,“[The crow has flown away:]”,The crow has flown away:,Swaying in the evening sun,A leafless tree, Natsume Soseki,The changing of the seasons is a theme common to Zen Buddhist philosophy and its influence can be felt in many haiku. Through a series of simple yet provocative images - Natsume Soseki captures the seamless shift as the summer sun sets to make way for the ‘leafless’ fall. 
Nagasaki,“Childless woman”,The childless woman,how tenderly she caresses,homeless dolls…, Hattori Ransetsu,An Edo-period samurai who became a poet under the tutelage of Matsuo Bashō - Ransetsu is not usually considered a heavy-hitter in the history of the haiku. He did - however - have his moments. Including this piece — a melancholy portrait that is very much the For sale: baby shoes never worn of its era.
Sumoto,“[Plum flower temple:]”,Plum flower temple:,Voices rise,From the foothills, Natsume Soseki,Natsume Soseki was known for weaving fairy tales into his haikus and this work is a perfect example. Through the myth-like depiction of the ‘plum flower temple’ or the unknown voices rising from the foothills - he creates a sense of wonder for the enigmas hidden in the world around us.
Kagoshima,“[The first soft snow:]”,The first soft snow:,leaves of the awed jonquil,bow low, Matsuo Bashō,This piece by Matsuo Bashō is another ode to the power of nature. You almost sense a certain reverence in the ‘awed’ jonquil leaves that ‘bow low’ to the snow — a reminder that all life. However beautiful - eventually gives way to nature. 
Hikone,“[A caterpillar]”,A caterpillar,this deep in fall,still not a butterfly., Matsuo Bashō,Matsuo Bashō’s brilliance is captured in this simple haiku which fully immerses you into the perspective of a caterpillar In just three lines. The way in which Bashō depicts the impatient caterpillar conveys a feeling of frustration and desire for growth. In doing so we realize the angst of unrealized potential.
Gifu,“[On the one-ton temple bell]”,On the one-ton temple bell,A moonmoth... folded into sleep,Sits still., Taniguchi Buson,Consider the sound that a ‘one-ton temple bell’ might make if it were to ring. That’s what Taniguchi Buson urges us to imagine juxtaposing this deep bell against the silent moonmoth - unaware that it might be violently distrubed at any possible moment.
Wakayama,“[Grasses wilt:]”,Grasses wilt:,the braking locomotive,grinds to a halt., Yamaguchi Seishi,A wilting grass and a braking locomotive: by juxtaposing the two. The poet has created a power dynamic between the images 一 one natural and one man-made. As the grass by the side of the tracks have wilted into the path of the locomotive - the poem suggests that even the mightiest of technological innovations must yield to nature.
Ueda,“[Everything I touch]”,Everything I touch,with tenderness alas,pricks like a bramble, Kobayashi Issa,The author Everything I touch speaks about the tangible pain he feels every time he seeks a kindred contact. Through only three lines - he conveys the wounds of love — and the unforgiving ache of connection.
