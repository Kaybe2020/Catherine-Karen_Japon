                    こんにちは,
                    <br> It 's writing "Konnichiwa" that means hello in Japanese. Let me introduce myself, I'm the
                    little guy on the right of your screen !
                    <br> My name is Kobayashi Issa. I live in the Edo era (1603 - 1868) in Kyoto.
                    Since I was a child, I have had a passion for writing and books.
                    <br> Being born in a modest family, I had to start working very early. One day, in the year of my
                    twentieth birthday, I decided to talk to my father that I was leaving and then I left home to start my life as a haijin.
                    <br> A haijin is a Japanese poet who looks at what is going on around him and expresses deep
                    feelings through short poems.
                    <br> Follow me to see one of my typical days !

                    <p class="legend">There is a haiku medley with its description and the name of the author (haijin)

                        <p class="explication">
                        <strong>What is a haiku?</strong>
                        A haiku doesn't just describe things, it requires the author's detachment. It usually expresses
                        a feeling. It is a kind of snapshot. It expresses an emotion, a fleeting feeling, the haiku
                        cannot be worked on, it is quick and concise. However, it doesn't exclude humour and figures of
                        speech, but all this must be used sparingly. It should be read in one breath, preferably aloud.
                        It is thought-provoking. It is a poem that isn't written, but lived.
                        <br>There are several types of haiku, those that evoke the seasons, those that deal with human
                        weaknesses. But there are also humorous and satirical poems, called Senryu.
                        <br>
                        <a class="aligneCentre">Haiku are generally written in three lines, for example :<br>
                            "Spring rain<br>
                            All things<br>
                            Beautifies (Chiyo-ni)"<br>
                            It must have a caesura and 17 mores (syllables) divided into three parts 5-7-5 :<br>
                            ha-tsu shi-gu-re (5) => The first rain <br>
                            sa-ru mo ko-mi-no wo (7) => The monkey also wants <br>
                            ho-shi-ge na-ri (5) => A little coat.</a>
                        A haiku must have as its main theme a season of which it evokes the presence in an implicit or
                        explicit way, but one must end up understanding the theme.
                        <br>The haijin (the poet), through this short text, tries to capture a moment of everyday life.
                        He doesn't give free expression to his feelings, but seeks to awaken a sensitivity with the help
                        of a reality (often associated with the natural world) which may seem banal to the reader.
                        <br>Finally, the syntax of a haiku should be simple.

                    Finding inspiration is sometimes difficult, which is why I like to walk along paths filled with
                    cherry blossom trees. Sometimes I even sit under one of these majestic trees to gain serenity.
                    These trees give off a lot of calm and soothe me. Thus, I can write more easily and with much
                    wisdom.
                    <br>The cherry trees don't bloom at the same time in Japan, so it is complicated to predict them
                    accurately. I change places of inspiration quite often because these places are magical and give birth to their
                    own haiku.
                    <br>Look at the number of magical places per year. The adventure never ends !

                        <strong>What is a sakura ?</strong>
                        The transience of the sakura's bloom has been used for centuries as a metaphor to emphasise the
                        ephemeral nature of both beauty and life. The sakura is thus used to explain the important
                        Japanese aesthetic concept of mono no aware (which can be translated as "sensitivity to the
                        ephemeral").
                        <br>The cherry blossom is one of the most significant natural events in spring in Japan.
                        Traditionally associated with the Hanami festivities, the cherry blossom is a very important
                        symbol for the Japanese. Much more than a simple flower, it is part of a centuries-old
                        philosophical trend and is today the emblem of an entire nation.
                        <br>Although today we take advantage of it to picnic and spend a pleasant moment with our loved
                        ones, it is important to know that it was not always like this. For a long time, cherry blossom
                        viewing was considered more of a philosophical activity than a simple moment of relaxation when
                        the weather was fine.
                        <br>With an average lifespan of two weeks, sakura trees are the very embodiment of the
                        ephemeral. Their petals can only be admired for a very short period of time, and their lightning 
                        passage on earth undoubtedly sends the admirer back to his or her own mortality. It is this mirror 
                        effect that encourages introspection and has made hanami a popular calendar event for artists and
                        philosophers throughout history.

                    <p class="explication">
                        <strong>What is a kanji?</strong>
                        Kanjisa (漢字) are signs derived from Chinese characters whose role is to write a part of the
                        Japanese language. A kanji represents one or more "readings". Kanji readings are derived either 
                        from ancient Chinese languages or from the original Japanese language (Yamato kotoba), which is 
                        not related to the Chinese languages.
                        <br>Mastering Kanji takes time, especially given the large number of signs used in practice and
                        the fact that a significant proportion of them have several readings at their disposal.
                        The Japanese language is atonic, and the compilation of kanji gave rise to numerous homophones.
                        Only the writing is authentic. For this reason - and for other historical and cultural reasons -
                        it would not be possible today to abolish kanji and establish a purely phonetic script. But the
                        language is still evolving, and contemporary means of communication are not hindered in Japan.
                        On the contrary, kanji have advantages: they are condensed information.
                        <br>This script remains very limited and is not really learned by the people. This is why
                        simplified scripts were created. This group of two new alphabets (hiragana and katakana) will be called
                        "kana".
                        <br>Hiragana derives from a set of kanji used in a purely phonetic way. In the past, there were
                        many more hiraganas (almost three hundred). For a given syllable, these syllabic characters were
                        used interchangeably, until the orthographic reform of 1900 which reduced the number to one character
                        per syllable. These phonetic characters were written in cursive style, and the character as a
                        whole underwent a very strong stylisation of the strokes. Hiragana was accessible to women (they
                        were called onnate, the women's hand), who only had access to elementary education: major
                        works of the Heian period (794-1185) were thus written by women in hiragana.
                        <br>The katakanas have a parallel origin: they result from a deliberate simplification of
                        man'yōgana for the use of monastery students, and date from the ninth century (early Heian
                        period). They were formed by retaining for each syllable only a few simple, easily traced strokes
                        characteristic of a particular man'yōgana, hence their name kata (片, 'partial, fragment'). These
                        strokes were later somewhat distorted by cursive tracing. Because of their origin, katagana are
                        visually much simpler than hiragana, and faster to draw.
                        <br>The two syllabaries (hiragana and katakana) make it possible to note all of the existing
                        sounds of the Japanese language (which could be written with these syllabaries alone). However,
                        the numerous homonyms present in Japanese would make it difficult to understand the meaning of
                        certain words; hence the interest of kanji.

                        <strong>What is a ramen?</strong>
                        Ramen is basically a dish of noodles, accompanied by a soup that gives them flavour. It is
                        an essential part of Japanese gastronomy, which has the particularity of being constantly
                        renewed over the last few decades.
                        <br>This popular dish, which remains a simple and nutritious way of eating noodles, was
                        originally influenced by Chinese culinary traditions. It was eaten in the trading ports of Japan in the
                        mid-19th century, prepared by Chinese who worked as dockers or cooks at the time.
                        <br>At the beginning of the 20th century, by adding soy sauce and dashi, the Japanese created
                        ramen, which quickly became popular. After the Second World War, in a quest for renewal and with the advent
                        of instant noodles, ramen became a real success and spread to the Japanese islands. From then
                        on, there was a wide variety of ramen and the ingredients were many and original, depending on
                        the season and the region, but also on the meats used. This diversity and craze around ramen has
                        given rise to a permanent national competition, always positive, which favours "kodawari", the
                        attention to detail that makes the difference in the composition and creation of a ramen.

                    you want for a new lesson. If now you want to go to Japan, my job is done ! Think of me when you'll be there !
                    <br>Now is the time to read your last haiku before going to sleep. おやすみ*
