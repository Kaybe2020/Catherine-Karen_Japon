                    Let me introduce myself, my name is Kobayashi Issa. I live in the Edo era (1603 - 1868) in Kyoto.
                    Since I was a child, I have had a passion for writing and books. Being born in a modest family, I
                    had to start working very early. One day, in the year of my twentieth birthday, I decided to talk to
                    my father and left home to start my life as a haijin.
                    A haijin is a Japanese poet who looks at what is going on around him and expresses deep feelings
                    through short poems.
                    Follow me as I explain one of my typical days!

                <div class="HaikuExplication">
                    <p>What is a haiku?<br>
                        A haiku does not just describe things, it requires the author's detachment. It usually expresses
                        a feeling. It is a kind of snapshot. It expresses an emotion, a fleeting feeling, the haiku
                        cannot
                        be worked on, it is quick and concise. However, it does not exclude humour8 and figures of
                        speech,
                        but all this must be used sparingly. It should be read in one breath, preferably aloud. It is
                        thought-provoking.

                        There are several types of haiku, those that evoke the seasons, those that deal with human
                        weaknesses. But there are also humorous and satirical poems, called Senryu.

                        Haiku are generally written in three lines<br>
                        Spring rain<br>
                        All things<br>
                        Beautifies (Chiyo-ni)<br>
                        It must have a caesura and 17 mores (syllables)
                        divided into three parts 5-7-5: ha-tsu shi-gu-re (5) => The first rain
                        sa-ru mo ko-mi-no wo (7) => The monkey also wants
                        ho-shi-ge na-ri (5) => A little coat.
                    </p>

                    Finding inspiration is sometimes difficult, which is why I like to walk along paths filled with
                    cherry blossom trees. Sometimes I even pause under one of these majestic trees to gain serenity.
                    These trees give off a lot of calm and soothe me. Thus, I can write more easily and with much
                    wisdom.
                    The cherry trees do not bloom at the same time in Japan, so it is difficult to predict them
                    accurately. I change the place of inspiration often vst at place is magical and gives birth to their
                    own haiku.
                    Look at the number of magical places per year. The adventure never ends!

                    <p class="explication">
                        The transience of the sakura's bloom has been used for centuries as a metaphor to emphasise the
                        ephemeral nature of both beauty and life5 . The sakura is thus used to explain the important
                        Japanese aesthetic concept of mono no aware (which can be translated as "sensitivity to the
                        ephemeral").

                        The cherry blossom is one of the most significant natural events in spring in Japan.

                        Traditionally associated with the Hanami festivities, the cherry blossom is a very important
                        symbol for the Japanese. Much more than a simple flower, it is part of a centuries-old
                        philosophical trend and is today the emblem of an entire nation.

                        Although today we take advantage of it to picnic and spend a pleasant moment with our loved
                        ones, it is important to know that it was not always like this. For a long time, cherry blossom
                        viewing was considered more of a philosophical activity than a simple moment of relaxation when
                        the weather was fine.

                        With an average lifespan of two weeks, sakura trees are the very embodiment of the ephemeral.
                        Their petals can only be admired for a very short period of time, and their lightning passage on
                        earth undoubtedly sends the admirer back to his or her own mortality. It is this mirror effect
                        that encourages introspection and has made hanami a popular calendar event for artists and
                        philosophers throughout history.

                        What is a kanji?<br>
                        Kanjisa (漢字) are signs derived from Chinese characters whose role is to write a part of the
                        Japanese language.
                        A kanji represents one or more "readings". Kanji readings are derived either from ancient
                        Chinese languages or from the original Japanese language (Yamato kotoba), which is not related
                        to the Chinese languages.
                        Mastering Kanji takes time, especially given the large number of signs used in practice and the
                        fact that a significant proportion of them have several readings at their disposal.
                        The Japanese language is atonic, and the compilation of kanji gave rise to numerous homophones.
                        Only the writing is authentic. For this reason - and for other historical and cultural reasons -
                        it would not be possible today to abolish kanji and establish a purely phonetic script. But the
                        language is still evolving, and contemporary means of communication are not hindered in Japan.
                        On the contrary, kanji have advantages: they are condensed information.

                        This script remains very limited and is not really learned by the people. This is why simplified
                        scripts were created. This group of two new alphabets (hiragana and katakana) will be called
                        "kana".
                        Hiragana derives from a set of kanji used in a purely phonetic way. In the past, there were many
                        more hiraganas (almost three hundred). For a given syllable, these syllabic characters were used
                        interchangeably, until the orthographic reform of 1900 which reduced the number to one character
                        per syllable. These phonetic characters were written in cursive style, and the character as a
                        whole underwent a very strong stylisation of the strokes. Hiragana was accessible to women (they
                        were called onnate12 , the women's hand), who only had access to elementary education: major
                        works of the Heian period (794-1185) were thus written by women in hiragana.

                        The katakanas have a parallel origin: they result from a deliberate simplification of man'yōgana
                        for the use of monastery students, and date from the ninth century (early Heian period)13. They
                        were formed by retaining for each syllable only a few simple, easily traced strokes
                        characteristic of a particular man'yōgana, hence their name kata (片, 'partial, fragment'). These
                        strokes were later somewhat distorted by cursive tracing. Because of their origin, katagana are
                        visually much simpler than hiragana, and faster to draw.
                        The two syllabaries (hiragana and katakana) make it possible to note all14 of the existing
                        sounds of the Japanese language (which could be written with these syllabaries alone). However,
                        the numerous homonyms present in Japanese would make it difficult to understand the meaning of
                        certain words; hence the interest of kanji.

                        What is ramen? <br>
                        Ramen is basically a dish of noodles, accompanied by a soup that gives them flavour. It is an
                        essential part of Japanese gastronomy, which has the particularity of being constantly renewed
                        over the last few decades.

                        This popular dish, which remains a simple and nutritious way of eating noodles, was originally
                        influenced by Chinese culinary traditions. It was eaten in the trading ports of Japan in the
                        mid-19th century, prepared by Chinese who worked as dockers or cooks at the time. At the
                        beginning of the 20th century, by adding soy sauce and dashi, the Japanese created ramen, which
                        quickly became popular. After the Second World War, in a quest for renewal and with the advent
                        of instant noodles, ramen became a real success and spread to the Japanese islands. From then
                        on, there was a wide variety of ramen and the ingredients were many and original, depending on
                        the season and the region, but also on the meats used. This diversity and craze around ramen has
                        given rise to a permanent national competition, always positive, which favours "kodawari", the
                        attention to detail that makes the difference in the composition and creation of a ramen.
                        Ramen is composed of five elements:
                        - The noodles,<br>
                        - The soup or broth,<br>
                        - The oil,<br>
                        - The toppings - the accompaniments - that go with the ramen,<br>
                        - The taré, a savoury base that the chef usually holds the secret of making.<br>
